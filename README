What is it?
===========
A greasemonkey script that adds a button to the egg.com allowing you to download your recent transactions and statements in the OFX format.


Installation
============
# Install Firefox (http://getfirefox.com)
# Install Greasemonkey (http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx-greasemonkey)
# Install this script (http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/62188)

*IMPORTANT* I very strongly advise you to use this in combination with your own local copy of the egg2ofx-server (http://github.com/chrisroos/egg2ofx-server).


Usage
=====
If you really truly understand the risks then you can use it as is, i.e. install it, visit your egg account and hit the download button.
If you want to use it with a local copy of the egg2ofx-server then you'll need to create a new firefox preference.

# Enter about:config in the location bar
# Right click somewhere on the list of existing preferences and select 'New > String'
# Enter 'greasemonkey.scriptvals.http://chrisroos.co.uk//Egg to Ofx.egg2ofxService' (without the quotes) as the preference name
# Enter the URL of your local egg2ofx-server as the value, e.g. http://egg2ofx.local

You'll be prompted with a warning when you click the Download as OFX button that includes the url of the server its going to send the data to.
